- 'type' added to output json object, when clicking on a file  
Ex. type:'image', type:'video' etc.

### Fixed

- When using config.downloadFormat: 'original' we got w/h = 0. (Fixed in this version)
- Some minor css text alignments

# 1.7.0 2025-02-26

### Added

- Support for "svg" files.  
Note! Setting "permanentURL" must be true

# 1.6.0 2025-01-17

### Added
- If using any of the default "Image size:s" and the image file type is .webp,  
the image asset will now be .webp (previous just supported .png).
- Setting for default image asset file type:  
```defaults: {imageDownloadFileType: "webp"} - with valid file types ["jpg" | "png" | "webp"]```  
Applies to default "Image size:s" and has heigher priority than the above "rule".

### Fixed
- Missing null check on "me.config.defaults.format"

# 1.5.0 2025-01-10

### Added
- Support to serve "pdf" files via asset server when/if setting "permanentURL" = true.  
(This adds '&permalink=true' to the download url.)
- Ability to shrink (not crop) an image to "fit" (cover/contain) inside a container (ex. div).
Using setting "defaults" with parameters 'width', 'height' and 'format'.
- New "default" formats: -100 (cover), -101 (contain) and -102 (none).  
Only used in conjunction with "defaults". Ex. ..., defaults:{width: 300, height: 200, format: -100}, ...
(-102 'none' means - take the whole image as is with its original width and height).  
If "deafult.format" = [-100 | -101 | -102] then the corresponding format is added to the "format selector" via code.
- New setting "defaults.disableCropper" - explicitly says that the cropper should not be used. The view is still rendered but without the actual cropper.
- New setting "hideLeftPaneCropperFileData" to explicitly hide all file data when in cropper view (display:none on the table).  
(Notice that the fields cannot be omitted completely as the logic in the code still uses them.)  

#### Note:  
If "defaults.disableCropper" = true and "deafult.format" = [-100 | -101 | -102] then "clickDone()" is called automatically (as we do not want/need to do anything more with the image).

### Fixed
- Webpack build setting - now includes "presets".  
.css files now end up in ./css/ folder.
- Preset inheritance issue.
